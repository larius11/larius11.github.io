title: First failed HackerRank.
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent it finishing up the Darwin project. Or at least trying to. I was unfortunately not able to pass the HackerRank tests. My code was able to simulate the behaviors of the classes and print them correctly, it just was not fast enough. I had been working on it throughout the week but did not manage to optimize it enough. I have also spent some time setting up a study schedule for my next Algo test.

## What is in my way?
Currently, the thing that is in my way is my work schedule. It is becoming more and more difficult to keep up with my classwork as work starts to get more busy with the holidays. Since these are the last few weeks I am simply trying to manage my time as best as I can. Next semester I am definitely going to have to change my schedule up.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I am focusing on my Algo test and trying to get my code done and start optimizations for the next project. Mainly to get all this done I need to get a schedule set up for each day. I also need to make sure I save enough time to also get the readings done. Once set up I simply need to stick to it in order to get everything done.

## What is my experience of the class?
Even though I did not get to optimize my code enough for HackerRank I am grateful that this class is forcing me to think about my code and how it is actually getting the stuff done. I am definitely going to try and get to the optimization part of my code much sooner than I did this past project. 

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would be to not spend too much time continuously on one specific bug. I would say that spending more than 30 minutes trying to figure a bug out is too much time spent not doing much. If the code is broken, revert back to a functioning version and try implementing the new code differently. Or, try getting something else done for the project, simply for the sake of staying productive and clearing your head a little.
