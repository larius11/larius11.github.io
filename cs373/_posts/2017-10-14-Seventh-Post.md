title: Done with tests. For now...
---
## What did I do this past week?  
This past week was spent getting ready for the test we just had this past Thursday. I decided to go about this by reviewing C++ algorithms and how C++ handles subclasses and structs. I also went over every quiz that was given out during class (highly recommend looking over these in detail for the future). Overall I am not quite satisfied with my performance on the test but I at least felt knowledgeable even of the things I got wrong.

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is a game that recently came out that turned out to be more addicting than I expected it to be. I usually try to stay away from video games during the semester since they can distract me from being productive while on the computer. However, this one game did not seem too time-consuming and rather easy to play and get the hang off. I was wrong. The game is called [CUPHEAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB0pShIwcQg). I chose to give it a try since the game is supposed to be beatable in just under two hours. Turns out that I am not good at this game, at all. I have spent 4 hours on it just this past week. With a full-time job and my classes, this amount of time is not something I can waste lightly. 

## What will I do next week?
Next week I am hoping to finish all of my work for the week before trying to continue my venture on CUPHEAD. Other than that, I need to shift my focus back to Algo since I really need to be absorbing all the material before the next test.

## What is my experience of the class?
Now that I know the structure of the tests  I know how to better prepare and understand the material. This is mainly for HackerRank since I did not know the complexity of the questions that would be asked on there.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would be to make sure you do not let tests intimidate you and make sure you READ what is being asked of you. During the HackerRank section, I skimmed through the instruction and ended up missing the functionality that I was being asked to implement and it cost me more time on that question than I had. Definitely will not make that mistake again.
