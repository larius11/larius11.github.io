## Why is this the best class you will ever take?
This class will open your mind to the real-life application of your programming skills. Professor Downing does a wonderful job of making sure the whole class is engaged and on the same page as far as what it is he is trying to get us to understand. He is direct with what he asks from his students in his projects and all assignments in general. If there is ever any ambiguity or inconsistency he will fix it if brought to his attention or adjust the grade accordingly. He is quick to listen and when asked a question he does not hesitate to spend time on fixing a student's understanding of what's going on. 

Something that stood out to me all throughout the course is the connection between every single assignment. I never felt like any of the assignments were simply to get a grade in, they all functioned like building blocks towards a specific idea or concept that is crucial to the real-life application of programming with an Object Oriented point of view. So far my experience when finishing a CS course here at UT I feel more knowledgeable on how to either use a computer, use a piece of software, understand the logic behind a computer but with this class, I feel ready to get a job in software development and comfortable sitting in an interview where I am asked how to build a specific application or how I would view the bigger picture.

I am thrilled to take Software Engineering with him next semester. I am currently waitlisted but hoping to get in soon!
