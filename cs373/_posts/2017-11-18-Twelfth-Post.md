## What did I do this past week?
This past week I've spent it setting up the Life project. The file set-up is still something I'm confused about but it seems like there will be 3 different "RunLife----.c++" files all using different functions defined in the ".h" file. This would go in line with the fact that there are three different HackerRank challenges for each type of Cell we need to accommodate. Regardless, I will ask more questions about it during class to ensure I am doing what I'm supposed to be doing. I have also been wrapping up all the material for Algo so that I can be successful in the final.

## What is in my way?
Currently, other than the details of the current project, I cannot think of anything being in my way. If anything it would be time as usual but like always, with proper management I should be able to get to everything. 

## What will I do next week?
Next week I am hoping to finish the project beore Thanksgiving so I can be at peace during break. Wednesday is going to be when I do the bulk of the project. So far I have most of the set up complete, I feel like the most time-consuming section is going to be the optimizing of the code. 

## What is my experience of the class? 
I am excited for the end of the semester so that I can have more free time but I will miss coming to this class. However, Software Engineering with Professor Downing is something I am looking forward to.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would be to take care of your health! I have been spending long nights finishing projects and studying and it is starting to have effects on my daily mood and performance overall. Sleep is important, and having a good diet is too. Last week I decided to sleep 8 hours then wake up and study for one hour, instead of trying to stay up making sure I review all the material. In the end, I felt really confident and even though I don't have my score just yet I am sure I will get a high score.
