## What did I do this past week?
This past week I had both homework due for Algo and a project due in this class. Since they were both due before the end of the week I was able to catch up on my sleep on Friday and this weekend. The pace for both classes is maintaining me engaged and constantly thinking of what is going on in each class. However, I am still struggling with the Algo class but thankfully I feel quite comfortable with this class. 

## What is in my way?
Currently, the only thing that is in my way is the time left in the semester and the amount of material left seems paramount. Other than that it is the same as usual; time. With the lack of time, I have been falling behind on my readings. I have been able to keep up with the reading from the web, however, I have not been keeping up with the book.

## What will I do next week?
For the upcoming week, I am hoping to catch up with the book readings and get started on the next project right away to make sure I do not end up rushing last minute. Also, I need to try and do readings online about the Algo material since I have been feeling kind of lost during lectures.

## What is my experience of the class?
My experience of the class is still very much the same as when we started. Professor Downing does a wonderful job of maintaining the class interested and constantly looking at a clear perspective of what is expected to be the learning point of each class and project. This is by far my favorite class I have ever taken.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would be to make sure you are talking to your classmates about the project and to always test your code against the public repo. The class as a whole will cover more edge cases than you will by yourself.
