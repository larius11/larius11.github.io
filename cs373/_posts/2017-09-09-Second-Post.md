title: Beginning to program.

## What did I do this past week?
This past week we began to dive into the first project for the semester. First, we covered the basics of the project; such as the goal, basic implementation, and how to set up the Github repositories. Then, we covered unit testing and how to implement that into the project as well as some optimizations for the code. Lastly, we covered Google tests and also learned how we are expected to implement it to the project. 

So far I've got the basic implementation of the project down, working on some optimizations. I've found it truly eye-opening to use the issue tracker on GitHub. It gives me a better perspective as to how far along my project I am. It seems as though my expected time to completion is going to be a couple hours short. This is due to **HackerRank** being more difficult to crack than expected. Hopefully, after I've implemented some caching my results will improve. I am currently timing out on two of the tests. 

## What is in my way?
Currently, I do not feel like anything is in my way directly. I would say that if my ultimate goal for this week is to finish Collatz and get full credit on all three quizzes the things in my way would be:
* Github issues (my path to finish the project)
* Weekly Readings

## What will I do next week?
I have budgeted time to finish both of those well before Thursday (due date). The readings are something I look forward to now. They have current knowledge into what I want to do in the future. They inspire me to seek more knowledge out to improve more than just my knowledge on computer science but also how software is used in industries.

## What is my experience of the class?
I enjoy the class extremely. From using notepad++ (I think, I need to double check the program next class) to type up the class' notes, to the down-to-earth lecture that Professor Downing delivers every class. One of the things I  did not expect to like was the daily quizzes. My experience in other classes was that they were simply reading checks and served as nothing but attendance and another grade to attach at the end of the semester. However, in this class Dr. Downing, even though some questions are still reading checks, has questions that force you to think about the current project. The answer to those questions are actually helpful for the project and makes them more valuable than just a daily grade.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is to set up all of your Git issues before you write a single line of code. I believe this is part of the workflow but I got so much out of setting up those issues early on that I believe it is definitely worth mentioning again. It sets up a path to follow through the entirety of the project and keeps you from losing track of your code. It also serves to let you know how much you have left.
