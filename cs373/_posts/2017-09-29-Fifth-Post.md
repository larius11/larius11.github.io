title: All nighters, when you need more time.

## What did I do this past week? 
This past week has been filled with lack of sleep, lots of caffeine, a lot of fun debugging and rain. With some homework due and a test coming up in Algo as well as a project due for OOP this week I have been having to juggle my work around more than usual while trying to maintain a healthy sleeping schedule; that did not happen. I ended up pulling an all-nighter Wednesday night to finish the project that was due Thursday night. However, the projects in this class are captivating, at least to me, since they are logic puzzles that you most likely will have a variant of out in the real world of software engineering.

Although during the ~21hours I spent working on the project I looked similar to this: </div>

## What is in my way?
Currently, besides the usual (not enough time & lack of sleep), nothing seems to be in my way. I suppose if anything the complexity of Algo is going to require me to do extra studying for the test. Mainly because I am having to figure everything about the homework from online sources since I have not been getting much out of lectures other than the names of things. But for this class, I just need good time management and the desire to learn how to best use C++.

## What will I do next week?
Next week the plan is to focus on the test coming up for Algo. Since there is no project due until 4 weeks from now, this should not be difficult to do. Maybe I will try to get more sleep. 

## What is my experience of the class?
I am still enjoying this class far more than I have my other CS classes. Professor Downing is great at making class informative and in-line to what I want from a CS class; to program and how to do it efficiently. So far, the projects have been fun and keep me engaged in the class. Can't wait for the next one to be posted. 

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is to fail often and quickly. At least when it comes to programming that is. I found that even when I thought an implementation for the solution to a project would be too slow or even get the problem wrong it was good to type it up and see it fail just to put something on the screen to go off of. Surely there is something correct even if the overall implementation is not working. The more you fail and the more quickly you can fail the more perspectives you get in your head of what is actually going on with the problem.
