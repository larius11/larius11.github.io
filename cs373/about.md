I am currently taking Alogrithms & Complexity along with Object-Oriented Programming. I am currently working full-time at H-E-B as a Central Checkout Supervisor. Last summer I interned with H-E-B as a Software Developer and got to see the real life problems and daily lives of people doing what I want to do once I graduate.
