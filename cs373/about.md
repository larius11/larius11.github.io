I am a fourth-year student currently taking Debugging & Verifying Programs, Concurrency, and Software Engineering. Currently, my work life consists of a full-time job at H-E-B as a Central Checkout Supervisor. Last summer I interned with H-E-B as a Software Developer and got to see the real-life problems and daily lives of people doing what I want to do once I graduate.
