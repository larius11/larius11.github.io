title: Sleep begins to slip...
---
<h2>What did I do this past week?</h2>
<p>With 429 and this class having projects due this upcoming week I have had a pretty busy week. Did about 15 hours of programming/debugging that got me nearly finished on both projects. Had to live off of 6 hours of sleep each night but to be honest, it is not that bad. I was certainly glad there was not a quiz on Friday because I had left my laptop at home and my phone was dead. If I had a list of some easy-to-do but essential tips to future students it would begin like this: 
<li>Never forget your charger!</li><li> Never forget your laptop!</li>
</p>

<h2>What's in my way?</h2>
<p>My current struggle has been budgetting time for myself. With my full-time job and rigorous school schedule it has become a task of mine to make sure I still take the time to enjoy myself by playing some videogames, write some music, or go down to the pool in my apartment complex. I also know as the projects become more extensive and complicated the time for this will either be very limited or maybe non-existent, so I gotta make sure I take advantage now before it's too late.</p>
<h2>What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>This Tuesday I do not have work or classes, so I will be in the lab all day. My goals for this week include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Finish Collatz, as well as my 429 project.</li>
	<li>Have one night where I get 8 hours of sleep.</li>
	<li>Get docker working, somewhere.</li>
</ul>   
<h3>Pick-Of-The-Week</h3>
<p>Since I started computer science in high school, and even before then when I would be playing online with some friends, I have always been fascinated with the different methods that we use for storing data. No matter how much data we can store right now, as humans, we will always need more. I found this neat wikipedia article about 
<a href='https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DNA_digital_data_storage'>DNA digital data storage.</a> Not to say that we will have our own personal computers use this method to store our files (mainly because retrieving the data takes some time) but on a more broad perspective, they can hold libraries of information in just a tiny drop.</p>
