## What did I do this past week?
This past week I spent it battling sickness while still going to work and attending most lectures. I had to skip Algo on Tuesday because I was in no condition to interact with people, much less sit in a classroom for an hour and a half. With the time spent at home, I was able to set up the second to last project of this semester; Darwin. This seems to be the most complex of the projects so far. I was glad to be able to get it set up rather quickly.

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is my sickness. I feel better than I did on Tuesday, however, I am definitely not done being sick. My main problem is having to go to work plus my school work. If I was able to come home and just work on my project on my laptop while laying down in bed it would not be much of a problem. But I have to do what I have to do. The semester is almost over and I have been holding up nicely. I just need to get over this bump.

## What will I do next week?
Next week my plan is to knockout Darwin as quickly as possible so that I can begin to study for the second Algo test of the semester. Based on the grade I get on the test I may have to take the class over so I need to spend a lot of time studying so that I can be successful and move on and be done with it. I also need to look into the UML diagram that is required for this project. I get the overall idea of what is expected but I need to install the software and clear it up in my head what my program is looking like. 

## What is my experience of the class?
Now that we are more than halfway through I feel comfortable with the quizzes on Canvas and have been getting full credit on most of them. I am also setting up projects with ease now and have had no trouble with Travis CI. I am thankful for the tools that I have been able to learn and get used to because of this class. As I've said on multiple blog entries in the past, this is definitely the class I've enjoyed the most while at UT. Hopefully, Software Engineering yields the same experience and maybe it'll even top this one.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip of the week would have to be to keep up with the readings and try to connect them to the lecture and the projects as soon as you can. Adjusting the way you write your code to follow the guidelines given in the readings and the things you learn during lecture make the whole process of working on the project much smoother.
