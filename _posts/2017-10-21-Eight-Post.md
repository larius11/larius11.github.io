title: Done with tests. For now...
---
## What did I do this past week?  
This past week I've spent it working on the project and collecting myself from the tests I just finished. There were calculations of averages to make sure I am where I need to be when it comes to my grades. My main concern was Algo, but after my professor releasing a grade cutoff, it looks like I am sitting at about a B-, much better than I was expecting.

## What is in my way?
Currently, I cannot think of anything that is standing in my way other than time and my ability to ask questions. I have been talking to other students about how they are doing and the way they understand things. Doing this has helped me better understand concepts and internalize them better since I get to see a different perspective that can help fill in gaps of knowledge. However, I am not good at asking such things from my classmates on a regular basis. I need to break out of my shell.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I am hoping to be finished with the project by Wednesday night. I also have Algo homework but that is due Tuesday and should be completed by Monday night. Other than that I am hoping I can take some time off from school and work Friday night. I really need to unplug for a second.

## What is my experience of the class?
It seems that now that we are getting comfortable with C++ and getting into bigger more complex concepts this class is getting to the meaty part. I am loving this. As I have said in previous posts, I strongly believe this class is preparing me for my life as a software developer. I am thankful for having the opportunity to take this class. 

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
The tip for this week is to not let your emotions get the better of you. If you feel like the concepts or the material is overwhelming, take a break. Get some food and watch something on Netflix. If you come back to it and you are still stumped ask questions on Piazza or during office hours. If all else fails the internet is a wonderful place with a vast amount of knowledge presented in many different ways. Never tell yourself you can't because then you won't.
