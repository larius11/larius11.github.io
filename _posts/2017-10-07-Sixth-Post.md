## What did I do this past week? 
This past week I spent it studying for Algo. I had some time here and there for sleeping and eating but mostly my efforts were focused on the homework that was due Thursday and the test which was the same day the homework was due. Regardless of all my efforts, I do not think I did well on that test. However, homework is weighted more heavily and I made sure my answers were pristine and precise. 

## What is in my way?
As of right now, I feel like I am doubting myself due to my poor performance on that Algo test. Although, I strongly believe that my method for studying for the test was simply not adequate and it is the main reason I did not do well. I thought it was going to be more concept based and test our knowledge of why things worked the way the did when instead it was more practical and actually demanded the designing of algorithms which I was too slow at and did not get to finish the test. I am hoping that the questions I was able to finish get me a decent grade. 

## What will I do next week?
Next week the plan is to focus on this class and get ready for the test. I feel prepared and knowledgeable on all of the content. I am fairly confident on my C++, and OOP concepts to take the test. Simply curious on how the test will be structured. Will it be all free response? Is it all through Canvas? I believe this information is on the syllabus, I'll have to go take a look once I am done writing this blog entry.

## What is my experience of the class?
The more of this class passes by, the more I realize Professor Downing is probably the best Professor that I've ever had the pleasure to learn from. He is clear on what he expects us to be getting out of lecture and is passionate about what he teaches. The orchestration between lecture, quizzes, readings, and projects keeps me engaged and interested in the class and programming in general. Looking forward to learning Software Engineering with him. 

## What is my tip(pick)-of-the-week?
Usually, I do a tip-of-the-week but this week I found an interesting article/book that I think is worth sharing with my class. The post is written by, Bartosz Milewski, the topic he covers is [Category Theory](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/11/04/category-the-essence-of-composition/). I have not finished reading it yet but it seems to be another level of abstraction when it comes to programming. Curious to see what y'all think.
