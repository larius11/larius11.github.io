## What did I do this past week? 
This past week has been filled with lack of sleep, lots of caffeine, a lot of fun debugging and rain. With some homework due and a test coming up in Algo as well as a project due for OOP this week I have been having to juggle my work around more than usual while trying to maintain a healthy sleeping schedule; that did not happen. I ended up pulling an all-nighter Wednesday night to finish the project that was due Thursday night. However, the projects in this class are captivating, at least to me, since they are logic puzzles that you most likely will have a variant of out in the real world of software engineering. Although during the ~21hours I spent working on the project I looked similar to this.
