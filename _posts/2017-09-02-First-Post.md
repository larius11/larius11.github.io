title: My first couple days in OOP.

## What are my expectations of this class?
In this class, I am expecting to broaden my perspective on what it means to be programming software. Not just in my own personal projects but rather for a business or a bigger purpose than just a personal website. I am also looking forward to using and learning C++ instead of Java for a change. Also, now that I know the structure of our daily quizzes I am looking forward to seeing how I perform in comparison to my classmates.

## What did I do this past week?
I spent this past week setting up my personal computer for future class projects by installing Docker and writing a basic C++ program to compile and run. I also made sure my CS account was ready to go and cleaned some files from last semester. Finally, I have done some of the readings for the upcoming week so I can stay ahead and be prepared.

## What is in my way?
Some challenges I am currently facing include my personal computer slowly dying, not having enough time, and I am getting married in December. Having to plan my weeks while taking all of this into account is not going to be easy. Frankly, none of these things are directly in my way but I need to keep them in mind to ensure I have a successful semester.

## What will I do next week?
The plan is to attend every class, finish Collatz as soon as possible, and figure out what questions I have to learn how I can go about answering them. With it being the second week of school I am also hoping to begin a more structured routine.

## What is my experience of the class?
So far it seems to be a class that will help develop me not just as a programmer but as an employee as well. I am looking forward to the speakers that will be attending class to let us know what they are looking for and what they have to offer. This class is getting me more excited to become a software engineer. 

## What is my tip-of-the-week?

If you have Windows 8, upgrade to Windows 10! **It is still free!** When trying to run Docker on my home computer (Which was running Windows 8) it complained that it needed to run on Windows 10. I know that some time ago Microsoft allowed for users to upgrade to Windows 10 for free but only for a limited time. However, after a quick google search, I found out that it is still possible to snatch this deal. Here is the link in case anyone needs it:
