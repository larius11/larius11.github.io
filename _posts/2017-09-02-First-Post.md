<h2>What are my expectations of this class?</h2>
<p>In this class, I am expecting to broaden my perspective on what it means to be programming software. Not just in my own personal projects but rather for a business or a bigger purpose than just a personal website. </p>

<h2>What did you do this past week?</h2>
<p>This past week I spent it setting up my computer for the future projects as well as making sure my CS account is ready for Collatz. I have done some of the reading for the following week </p>

<h2>What's in your way?</h2>
