title: Last Project and Some Turkey.
---
## What did I do this past week?
This past week I've spent it getting ready for the holidays. Buying presents, planning get-togethers, and trying to squeeze in some time to work on the last project for this class. There is also some homework that I have to turn in this upcoming week for Algo, not the last one but still on my to-do list. With the time that I've spent on the current project, it seems like getting it done by Tuesday is going to be challenging. Most of the logic for my project is there but HackerRank is proving to have some rigorous tests.

## What is in my way?
Currently in my way is those HackerRank tests and as always the time available to actually work on the project. Now that Thanksgiving is behind me I have this weekend to work but I also have two 8 hour shifts to deal with and somehow try to get enough sleep and eat. Other than that, the semester is coming to a close and nothing else is in my way.

## What will I do next week?
Next week I hope to be able to focus on finishing up my Algo homework and get some study sessions scheduled for the finals coming up the week following that. I should be done with the last project this weekend so I am hoping to not be working on that next week. Mainly because there is going to be two different homework assignments due in Algo that I want to be able to focus on.

## What is my experience of the class? 
I am quite satisfied with what we learned, how we've learned, and how our knowledge has been tested in this class. By far my favorite course throughout my entire experience at UT.

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week would have to be to make sure you take breaks between consecutive failures on HackerRank. Sometimes starting fresh on a bug can help clear things up on your code.
