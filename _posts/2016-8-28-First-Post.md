title: My first couple days in OOP.
---
<h2>What did I do this past week?</h2>
<p>It has been just two days and I already feel like a more "complete" programmer. The simple fact that I get to create this blog for the class to document my progress is exciting.</p>
<h2>What's in my way?</h2>
<p>Well, obstacle number one has been getting Docker to work in my home computer. For some reason I get an error about exiting a database as I try to simply start up the program. Thankfully, someone on Piazza directed me to get the Docker toolbox as an alternative. Now I just have to wait until we start using it to see if it works.</p>
<h2>What will I do next week?</h2>
<p>For now I am just going to further customize this blog and try to get started on Project 0 as soon as possible. My schedule is very tight since I am working full-time at H-E-B as a Service Manager and also taking CS 429 (Operating Systems) along with this course. With such a rigorous schedule and such complex projects for which I have to make sure I stay ahead I am gratefull to have a professor that requires us to participate in the class and have us work together in the projects. With that said, I am eagerly looking forward to these projects to get to know more of my fellow CS classmates, and more importantly, help each other become better at what we love doing.</p>    


<p>Here is a quote from our textbook that resonated with me,</p>
