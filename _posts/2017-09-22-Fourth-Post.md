title: The time dilemma.
---
## What did I do this past week? 
This past week was spent building my own computer from scratch for the first time. Since I have been surrounded by computers my entire life the components of a computer are familiar to me. However, I have never assembled them before. I learned a lot on how to handle each individual part and more about the way they physically interact with each other. I also started on the second project and have been trying to keep up with my Algorithms & Complexity class; proofs have never been my fort√©.

## What is in my way?
Currently, I am torn between not having enough time and wanting to work with a partner and feeling that my lack of time will end up hindering my partners progress through the projects. It is no problem for me to stay up and finish the project on an all-nighter. Yet, I am aware that not everyone is okay with doing that, especially if you have time to do it during the day like a normal human being. This project is not too complicated and I feel comfortable enough with the logic to be able to knock it out by myself so I did not try too much to find someone with a similar schedule. Nonetheless, as the projects get more complicated I am certain that I am going to need a partner to help me succeed. 

## What will I do next week?
This upcoming week I plan to continue to keep up with the readings and really crack down on that Algo homework. That is due Tuesday which leaves all day Wednesday for me to finish Project #2 before Thursday. With the set-up I got, it is simply a matter of optimizing the code enough for HackerRank and adding good tests. 

## What is my experience of the class?
A subtle thing that I am enjoying about the class is the exposure to different languages. This came to me as I read through the "Eight Queens" puzzle in the book. It later came back to me when we analyzed how the syntax between Java, C++, C, and Python varies as well as curious differences in the interpretation of operators. By no means are we delving deep into how each individual language does every little thing (After all, this is Object-Oriented Programming as applied in C++) but just seeing some key differences is nice. 

## What is my tip-of-the-week?
My tip-of-the-week is that you must be *extra careful* when installing an after-market fan for your CPU. I did not lock mine in place correctly when doing it and it caused it to fall onto my CPU. It did not damage the processor directly however, it did bend the pins on my motherboard. I had to go buy another motherboard due to this mistake.
